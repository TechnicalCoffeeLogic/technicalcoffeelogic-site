Deciding on a framework to start my current project and future ones, a framework that I will be dedicated to is time intensive research and a big decision. I ended up landing on Vue.js as my framework of choice. Below is why I chose Vue, what I did to install it, and how I started the journey learning this framework.

### **Why?**

I am going to keep this short and simple. I chose Vue due to being the only developer on my projects and it offered me quick startup and was intuitive. The intuitiveness of Vue is subjective by the way, you may understand react easier than Vue. That is it, the router or state management didn’t win me over, because it is obvious when choosing between any well established framework, any of those frameworks will get the job done for you.

So how did I do my research before making the choice of Vue? My research consisted of watching/listening to quite a bit of pros and con YouTube videos on why a framework is better than the other, really nothing more than that.

Also as a side note, I had zero experience with Vue before, but probably have an intermediate level of understanding with java script before this journey. Though I had not messed with JS in 5 years.

### **The Short Journey, That is Actually A Long Journey**

How did I learn/ am still learning Vue. I started by going through the beginner tutorial on Vue 3 at vuemastery.com (link below).

Once I finished that tutorial, I worked on refactoring a previous project that was in vanilla JSto use the Vue framwork. That is the best way I learn, get a small grasp on something then just jump in. I definitely feel like I remember things better that way.

So, my advice is get out of tutorials as fast as possible and start a project, which could be making a website about something you like, or refactoring an older project.

### **Installing and Starting**

There seems like a billion different ways to do things when creating a project and what to use, below were the easiest and quickest to use in my opinion.

#### **NPM**

_These are the commands to use within the terminal_

1. check if npm is installed “npm -v”

2. update npm globally “npm update -g”

#### **Build Tool — Vite**

_These are the commands to use within the terminal_

1. install vite “npm i vite”

#### **Create new Vue App with Vite**

_These are the commands to use within the terminal_

1. npm create vite@latest

#### **Running Your Vue.js App**

_These are the commands to use within the terminal_

1. npm install

2. npm run dev

#### **Deploying Your App**

_These are the commands to use within the terminal_

1. npx vite build

Grab the “dis” folder and move it to your server. Also, this is probably a lame of doing this, but I am a noob, so this was really easy for me.

Well that is my journey thus far. I hope this helps in some way and encourages you to just go for it.
