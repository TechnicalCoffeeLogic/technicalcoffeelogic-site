Your days are busy, and you don’t feel like you are able to be productive with side hustles/side projects/learning things that interest you: here is a concept that has helped me be more productive in my life.

To start off, being productive should not be understood as making a ton of progress in one day. Instead, think of progress in the long term, and gaining wealth over a long period of time will add up. If you keep the long game in mind you can be productive by plodding.

**Plodding**

What is plodding? Well, it is making a little progress every day over the long term. When you look back in a year or more, you will realize how far you have come. I didn’t come up with this idea, but got it from the book “Ploductivity” by Douglas Wilson. Definitely check it out, here is the link to the book: [https://canonpress.com/products/ploductivity/](https://canonpress.com/products/ploductivity/)

Plodding involves being consistent and disciplined day in and day out, but it is being consistent with completing a small amount of work every day that is part of a bigger project. Plodding is a theme that is seen throughout the book of Proverbs, for example, _Proverbs 13:11 “Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it” _and_ _Proverbs 21:5 _“The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.”_ When talking about gaining wealth, which is exactly what my aim is when being productive, plodding seems to be the key. (Wealth is seen as wisdom, knowledge, building things, and also money)

Not only is gaining little by little (plodding) a concept in the book of Proverbs, but it is how God has set up His creation. This is seen through the cultural mandate in Genesis 1 

>“And God blessed them. And God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.’ ” 

_This being fruitful and multiplying is not something that can be done overnight, but over a long period of time._ _We also see this idea of plodding in how the Kingdom of heaven is described in the parable of the leaven in Matthew 13:33

>“He told them another parable. ‘The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened.’ ”

So plodding is a way of being productive over a long period of time through consistency and discipline every day. Start by determining what you want to accomplish, then break that down into small chunks that you know you can accomplish everyday, and once you have that, start to be consistent about it.


# **Some Examples of Plodding in My Life**

Here are some ways that I have implemented plodding in my life, hopefully it will help you get started with this concept.



1. Reading — I wanted to read a lot of books this year, so I added up the total pages of the books that I wanted to read and divided that by 365 days to determine how many pages a day I needed to read to get through all the books. It ended up I only needed to read 13 pages per day to get through all 8 books (4,614 pages), which is a really obtainable daily goal.
2. Building out a web app — I ended up breaking down a web app that I am developing into smaller chunks and work on each smaller piece for about an hour each night. Turns out it is coming together a lot faster than I originally though by using the plodding technique.

Hope this will help you in being more productive to the glory of God.
